       <h3><strong>Who is Furina?</strong></h3>
       <h3><strong>What is Fontaine?</strong></h3>
       <p>Furina de Fontaine is a playable Hydro character in Genshin Impact who can alternate between Pneuma and Ousia alignments. Flamboyant and imprudent, Furina lives for the thrill of the courtroom, often speaking in a manner peppered with bravado and drama. She is impatient and has a childlike temper, and she will occasionally make judgments that she doesn't mean, which Neuvillette frequently has to control while conducting a trial to avoid complications. While she enjoys being in the spotlight, she only does so when it is focused at her positively, breaking down in complete shambles should something go out of plan and will try to save face at the first possible opportunity.</p>
       <p>Of the regions of Teyvat, Fontaine prides itself as the hub of culture and the arts. The newspaper The Steambird is the main newspaper of the Court of Fontaine. According to the Steambird, Fontaine is located in the center of Teyvat and is the source of all waters on the continent. Its entire continental plate is elevated, making it significantly higher than other nations. At the edge of Fontaine is a massive waterfall that stretches for thousands of meters.</p>
